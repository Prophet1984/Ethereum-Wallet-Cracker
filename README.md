# HOW TO RUN
Just start **run.bat** in Command Prompt

# WHY DO THIS?
Just like with bitcoin, there are some ethereum wallets with high balances that are lost forever, which means nobody can access them and the money is basically there just to be picked up by anyone. This program can possibly find these lost wallets and their matching private keys & 12 words and take the eth out of them.

# NOTE
I'm not actually responsible for what you do with this. Don't steal active wallet money, that's just wrong. Not to mention the new wallets are most likely protected much more with extra password and stuff.

# Also Note
It's almost impossible to find anything. The chances of winning are extremely low. You could get lucky though, good luck!

# Why would this even be possible?
Because most used apps for ethereum use only one main Derivation Path and don't even use extra passwords or anything for new wallets.
